		As a very well-traveled bug, you've long lamented the lack of beautiful art available to you and
		your fellow bugs.
	</p>
	<p class="text-center w-1/2 mx-auto">
		So you started a museum! You might notice it's looking pretty empty, but that's okay, it's your
		job to fill it with new art.
	</p>
	<p class="text-center w-1/2 mx-auto">
		Using your memory of the paintings you've seen on your travels, you will create faithful (albeit
		very tiny) reproductions to display on the walls.
