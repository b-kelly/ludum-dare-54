	<p>
		As a very well-traveled bug, you've long lamented the lack of beautiful art available to you and
		your fellow bugs.
	</p>
	<p>
		So you started a museum! You might notice it's looking pretty empty, but that's okay, it's your
		job to fill it with new art.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using your memory of the paintings you've seen on your travels (don't worry, you'll be able to
		see them on screen!), you will create faithful (albeit very tiny) reproductions to display on
		the walls.
